Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance analytics engineering consultant. I can help you and your business:
* Negotiate a free year of [Looker](https://www.looker.com/) and write your first LookML models
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for your [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) data warehouse
* Set up [dbt Cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/) so you can write schedulable SQL pipelines complete with a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, Slack alerts, and a fully hosted data documentation site
* ...and much more!

Drop me an email at kenny@kndata.co if you'd like to learn more.
