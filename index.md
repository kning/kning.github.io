## :nerd_face: Data
I'm a freelance analytics engineer, previously at [Better.com](better.com) and [Spotify](spotify.com). I help small to mid-size companies get the most out of technology that empowers data analysis.

I can:
* Teach how to use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) effectively as a data transform tool and how best to integrate it across your tech stack.
* Determine the right [business intelligence tool](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/choosing-the-right-bi-tool-for-the-right-use-case-at-better) (e.g. Looker, Tableau) for your business.
* Augment your analytics team and tackle those projects that you can never find time to get to.
* Help with anything else related to data warehousing, ETL, and data strategy.

Email kenny@kndata.co if you're interested in working together.

## :headphones: Music
I'm a music producer, pianist, and vocalist. I make beats and perform in NYC solo or with groups whenever possible. I like all kinds of music, but my greatest inspirations are electronic, hip hop, and neo soul. Here is a selected discography:
* [shop#3](https://audius.co/kmeans/shop3-435866) (winner of 6/15/21 [MJ Cole remix competition](https://audius.co/mjcole/playlist/mjs-chopshop-top3-winners-50782))
* [A Beautiful Archive](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Xbixzpr0xzlPdQSjzHXBk?si=CbhPZLqrRX225hmHYbyTPQ&dl_branch=1) by Maurice
