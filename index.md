I'm currently a growth engineer at [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/) where I focus on how to grow the business among our core AI user base and beyond. I have special expertise in analytics platforms and technical marketing, skills I have built my freelance business around for over three years. Prior to freelancing, I was a founding data engineer at Better.com and a lead data scientist on Spotify's Content team.

## Analytics engineering
I select and implement analytics infrastructure to make data-informed decision making as easy as possible. I have particular expertise in Looker and dbt, but am also official partners with tools like Snowflake and Fivetran.

Selected past work:
* Automated a critical board deck report and underlying end-to-end data stack of Snowflake, Fivetran, dbt, and Hex within first 20 hour sprint
* Developed an 18-input daily user unit economics model, automating financial reporting and enabling LTV analysis to understand the true value of different product features
* Spearheaded the adoption of dbt and Looker for a Series D fintech client, significantly improving reporting consistency while driving down time to code merge by 90%
* Designed and created a last touch attribution model and associated dashboards, enabling marketing to assess ROI of $1M / month spend down to the user-campaign level
* Standardized business and product metrics such as loan volume and missed calls, providing a trusted analytics platform for >500 weekly active users
* Collaborated with product, finance, and content on an A/B test for sleep music search ranking, demonstrating we could drive traffic to Spotify-owned properties and save up to 1% on gross margin without impacting the user experience
