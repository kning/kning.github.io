I'm a freelance analytics engineer helping companies build analytics infrastructure.

## Infrastructure solutions
My core work centers around helping businesses select and implement analytics infrastructure. I'm an official dbt Labs partner and have expertise in tools like Looker, Snowflake, and Fivetran.

Selected past client work:
* Delivered robust and secure data reporting solution for client's customers via dbt and Snowflake data sharing
* Reduced % of long-running (>2m) analytics queries from 14% to 3% by migrating Looker backend from Postgres to Snowflake
* Reduced errors in production and provided greater transparency for stakeholders by upgrading data pipeline tooling to dbt Cloud
* Improved allocation of marketing dollars by unifying ad network and first-party click data into a single dataset
* Developed a python script to identify the most significant drivers in conversion variance across multiple dimensions, saving time spent doing exploratory analysis

## Technical blogging
I contribute to startups' public blogs to help them establish credibility in the data space.

Selected writing:
* Datafold: [Different ways to diff](https://www.datafold.com/blog/different-ways-to-diff-data?exp_id=2)
* Datafold: [How to onboard analytics engineers](https://www.datafold.com/blog/how-to-onboard-analytics-engineers?exp_id=2)
* Water & Music: [Why podcasts won't save Spotify](https://www.waterandmusic.com/why-podcasts-wont-save-spotify/)
* How to fix your LookML project structure (coming soon)

## Community work
I'm actively involved in the greater data and analytics community as a way to keep up to date with the latest trends and maintain a strong network.

Selected community work:
* dbt Coalesce 2020 talk: [Kiro dreams of data](https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce-2020/kiro-dreams-of-data/)
