I'm an independent freelance analytics engineer having provided BI solutions to over a dozen clients across fintech, e-commerce, and healthcare.

I help businesses through three main professional services: analytics engineering, technical blogging, and go-to-market strategy.

## Analytics engineering
I select and implement analytics infrastructure to make data-informed decision making as easy as possible. I have particular expertise in Looker and dbt, but am also official partners with tools like Snowflake and Fivetran.

Selected past work:
* Developed an 18-input daily user unit economics model, automating financial reporting and enabling LTV analysis to understand the true value of different product features
* Spearheaded the adoption of dbt and Looker for a Series D fintech client, significantly improving reporting consistency while driving down time to code merge by 90%
* Designed and created a last touch attribution model and associated dashboards, enabling marketing to assess ROI of $1M / month spend down to the user-campaign level
* Standardized business and product metrics such as loan volume and missed calls, providing a trusted analytics platform for >500 weekly active users
* Collaborated with product, finance, and content on an A/B test for sleep music search ranking, demonstrating we could drive traffic to Spotify-owned properties and save up to 1% on gross margin without impacting the user experience

Companies: Spotify, Better, Current, Findigs, Seatgeek, obe Fitness, Clearcover, Miles Partnership

## Technical blogging
I contribute to businesses' public blogs to help them establish credibility, especially among other data professionals.

## Go-to-market strategy
I advise startups on their go-to-market strategy with an emphasis on content strategy (e.g. blogs, podcasts, influencer marketing). In addition to my data background, I have a strong user and market research background that enables me to take a qualitative and quantitative hybrid approach to identifying new market oppotunities.

Companies: dbt, Deep Channel, Supergrain

## Community work
I'm actively involved in the greater data and analytics community as a way to keep up to date with the latest trends and maintain a strong network.

Selected community work:
