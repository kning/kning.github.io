I'm a freelance analytics engineer helping businesses build analytics infrastructure.

## Infrastructure solutions
I help businesses select and implement analytics infrastructure. I have particular expertise in Looker, but I'm also official partners with dbt Labs, Snowflake, and Fivetran.

Selected past client work:
* Delivered robust and secure data reporting solution for client's customers via dbt and Snowflake data sharing
* Reduced % of long-running (>2m) analytics queries from 14% to 3% by migrating Looker backend from Postgres to Snowflake
* Reduced errors in production and provided greater transparency for stakeholders by upgrading data pipeline tooling to dbt Cloud
* Improved allocation of marketing dollars by unifying ad network and first-party click data into a single dataset
* Developed a python script to identify the most significant drivers in conversion variance across multiple dimensions, saving time spent doing exploratory analysis

## Technical blogging
I contribute to businesses' public blogs to help them establish credibility in the data space.

Selected writing:
* Spectacles: [How to fix your LookML project](https://www.spectacles.dev/post/fix-your-lookml-project-structure)

## Community work
I'm actively involved in the greater data and analytics community as a way to keep up to date with the latest trends and maintain a strong network.
