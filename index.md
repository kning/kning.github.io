I'm a freelance analytics engineer with 9 years of experience across data roles and at companies ranging in size from early-stage startups to public companies.

I help businesses through three main professional services: analytics infrastructure solutions, technical blogging, and go-to-market strategy.

## Analytics infrastructure solutions
I select and implement analytics infrastructure to make data-informed decision making as easy as possible. I have particular expertise in Looker, but I'm also official partners with dbt Labs, Snowflake, and Fivetran.

Selected past work:
* Rebuilt last touch marketing attribution pipeline from ground-up to improve trust in marketing data and prototype a more efficient analytics workflow using dbt, Looker, and Airflow
* Implemented end-to-end analytics platform of Looker, Snowflake, Fivetran, dbt, and Hightouch, enabling a data team of one to comfortably manage dozens of complex external reporting requirements
* Standardized business and product metrics such as loan volume and missed calls, providing a trusted analytics platform for >500 weekly active users

Companies: Spotify, Better, Seatgeek, Current, Findigs, obe Fitness, Clearcover, Fast Growing Trees

## Technical blogging
I contribute to businesses' public blogs to help them establish credibility, especially among other data professionals.

## Go-to-market strategy
I advise startups on their go-to-market strategy with an emphasis on top-of-funnel awareness via content strategy (e.g. blogs, podcasts, influencer marketing). In addition to my data background, I have a strong user and market research background that enables me to take a more holistic, yet still scientific, approach to identifying new market oppotunities.

Companies: dbt, Supergrain, Deep Channel

## Community work
I'm actively involved in the greater data and analytics community as a way to keep up to date with the latest trends and maintain a strong network.
